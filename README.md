# PidgeonTalk
PidgeonTalk is an augmentative and alternative communication device that utilizes a synthological language that allows for greater range of expression in individuals with nonverbal autism or other speech difficulties. The language matrix behind the system's function allows for maximum customization, allowing it to be used for languages other than English.

## Setting up
Build the solution as normal, and move the "Scripts" folder into your working path.
* Run "GeneratePools.rb," this creates a word pool for each part of speech.
* Run "GenerateTable.rb," this creates a translation table.
Run the executable and it should work.

## Configuation
More documentation will be added here as I make the system more intuitive.
