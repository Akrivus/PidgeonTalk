# PidgeonTalk
PidgeonTalk is an augmentative and alternative communication device that utilizes a synthological language that allows for greater range of expression in individuals with nonverbal autism or other speech difficulties. The system can theoretically provide more expressions than a standard $3,000 AAC device, and is open source to allow for greater flexibility, maintenence, and personalization.

## Setting up
Build the solution as normal, and move the "Scripts" folder into your working path. Once started, the program should work provided you have text to speech working.

More information will come in regarding the user's ability to change, add, or augment the current language data to fit your precise needs.
